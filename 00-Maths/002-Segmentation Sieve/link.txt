## Problems with Simple Sieve:

The Sieve of Eratosthenes looks good, but consider the situation when n is large, the Simple Sieve faces following issues.

- An array of size Θ(n) may not fit in memory

- The simple Sieve is not cache friendly even for slightly bigger n. The algorithm traverses the array without locality of reference


## Segmented Sieve
The idea of segmented sieve is to divide the range [0..n-1] in different segments and compute primes in all segments one by one. This algorithm first uses Simple Sieve to find primes smaller than or equal to √(n).
