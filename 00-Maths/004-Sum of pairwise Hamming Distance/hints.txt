## Access Hint:

Suppose the given array contains only binary numbers, i.e A[i] belongs to [0, 1].

Let X be the number of elements equal to 0, and Y be the number of elements equals to 1.

Then, sum of hamming distance of all pair of elements equals 2XY, as every pair containing one element from X and one element from Y contribute 1 to the sum.

As A[i] belongs to [0, 231 - 1] and we are counting number of different bits in each pair, we can consider all the 31 bit positions independent.

For example:
A = [2, 4, 6] = [0102, 1002, 1102]</p>

At bit position 0 (LSB): x = 3, y = 0
At bit position 1: x = 1, y = 2
At bit position 2(MSB): x = 1, y = 2

Total sum = number of pairs having different bit at each bit-position = (2 * 3 * 0) + (2 * 1 * 2) + (2 * 1 * 2) = 8

Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)
