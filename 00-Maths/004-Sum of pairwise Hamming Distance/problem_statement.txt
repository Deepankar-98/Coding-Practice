link -- https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/sum-of-pairwise-hamming-distance/

Problem Description

Hamming distance between two non-negative integers is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given an array A of N non-negative integers, find the sum of hamming distances of all pairs of integers in the array. Return the answer modulo 1000000007.



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 200000

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
First and only argument is array A.



Output Format
Return one integer, the answer to the problem.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 4, 6]


Example Output
Output 1:

 0
Output 2:

 8


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
No pairs are formed.

Explanation 2:
 We return, f(2, 2) + f(2, 4) + f(2, 6) + f(4, 2) + f(4, 4) + f(4, 6) + f(6, 2) + f(6, 4) + f(6, 6) = 8
