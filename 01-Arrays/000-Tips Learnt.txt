Most array based problems can be solved using the following:

1. Kedane's Algorithm (including all -ve values): For getting maximum result for something

2. prefix[] and suffix[] tables : Depending on problem

3. Binary Search : For log(n) time
   
   l=0, h=n-1, Use mid-1, mid+1

4. 2 pointer approach
