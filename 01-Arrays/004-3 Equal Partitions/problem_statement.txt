Link -- https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/partitions/



## Problem Statement:

You are given a 1D integer array B containing A integers.

Count the number of ways to split all the elements of the array into 3 contiguous parts so that the sum of elements in each part is the same.

Such that : sum(B[1],..B[i]) = sum(B[i+1],...B[j]) = sum(B[j+1],...B[n])



## Problem Constraints:

1 <= A <= 105
-109 <= B[i] <= 109
