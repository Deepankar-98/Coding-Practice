Link -- https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/balance-array/


## Problem Description

Given an integer array A of size N. You need to count the number of special elements in the given array.

A element is special if removal of that element make the array balanced.

Array will be balanced if sum of even index element equal to sum of odd index element.



## Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 109



## Input Format
First and only argument is an integer array A of size N.



## Output Format
Return an integer denoting the count of special elements.



## Example Input:
Input 1:

 A = [2, 1, 6, 4]
Input 2:

 A = [5, 5, 2, 5, 8]


Example Output
Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 2


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 After deleting 1 from array : {2,6,4}
    (2+4) = (6)
 Hence 1 is the only special element, so count is 1
Explanation 2:

 If we delete A[0] or A[1] , array will be balanced
    (5+5) = (2+8)
 So A[0] and A[1] are special elements, so count is 2.
