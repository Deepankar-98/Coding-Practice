# Triplets with Sum between given range

## Problem Description

Given an array of real numbers greater than zero in form of strings.
Find if there exists a triplet (a,b,c) such that 1 < a+b+c < 2 .
Return 1 for true or 0 for false.

Example:

Given [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.2, 0.4] ,

You should return 1

as

0.6+0.7+0.4=1.7

1<1.7<2

Hence, the output is 1.

O(n) solution is expected.

Note: You can assume the numbers in strings donâ€™t overflow the primitive data type and there are no leading zeroes in numbers. Extra memory usage is allowed.
