Link -- https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/


## Problem Description:
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, d, ... in nums such that a + b + c + d + ... N = target?
Find all unique n sets in the array which gives the sum of target.


Note:
The solution set must not contain duplicate terms.


Example:
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0 and N=4.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
