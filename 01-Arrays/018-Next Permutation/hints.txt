It might help to write down the next permutation on paper to see how and when the sequence changes.

Youâ€™ll realize the following pattern :

The suffix which gets affected is in a descending order before the change.

A swap with the smaller element happens and then we reverse the affected suffix.

    1 2 3 -> 1 3 2   // Suffix being just the 3. 

    1 2 3 6 5 4  -> 1 2 4 3 5 6 // Suffix being 6 5 4 in this case.
