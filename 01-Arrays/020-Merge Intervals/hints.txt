Access Hint:

Have you covered the following corner cases :

1) Size of interval array as 0.

2) newInterval being an interval preceding all intervals in the array.
    Given interval (3,6),(8,10), insert and merge (1,2)

3) newInterval being an interval succeeding all intervals in the array.
    Given interval (1,2), (3,6), insert and merge (8,10)

4) newInterval not overlapping with any interval and falling in between 2 intervals in the array.
    Given interval (1,2), (8,10) insert and merge (3,6) 

5) newInterval covering all given intervals.
    Given interval (3, 5), (7, 9) insert and merge (1, 10)
