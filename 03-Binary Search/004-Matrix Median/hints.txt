We cannot use extra memory, so we canâ€™t actually store all elements in an array and sort the array.
But since, rows are sorted it must be of some use, right?

Note that in a row you can binary search to find how many elements are smaller than a value X in O(log M).
This is the base of our solution.

Say k = N*M/2. We need to find (k + 1)^th smallest element.
We can use binary search on answer. In O(N log M), we can count how many elements are smaller than X in the matrix.

So, we use binary search on interval [1, INT_MAX]. So, total complexity is O(30 * N log M).

Note:
This problem can be solve by using min-heap, but extra memory is not allowed.
