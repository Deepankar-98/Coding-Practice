## Access Hint

The Problem is based on **Binary Search**

So let’s start with thinking of monotonicity.

If you set a height parameter to something let’s say x and you are able to remove atleast B metres amount of wood then for every parameter less than x you can remove atleast B metres of wood.

This means you need to find the last x such that for every height parameter greater than x you cannot remove atleast B metres of wood.

So we just to binary search for this x.

Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Space Complexity: O(1)
