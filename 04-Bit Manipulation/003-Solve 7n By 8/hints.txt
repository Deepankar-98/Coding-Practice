## Intution 1:
On dividing a no: A by 2^k,
the remainder is the least significant k bits and the quotient is the rest of the bits.

Eg:
On dividing 109=1101101 by 8=1000, we get:

1101      |  101
quotient     Remainder
= 13         = 5

Note: Only valid for powers of 2



## Intution 2:
a<<k = a * (2^k)

Eg: 
a<<3 = a * (2^3) = 8a



## Intution 3:
Moreover:
7n/8 = (8n-n)/8

Therefore soln. is -- (n<<3 - n)>>3
