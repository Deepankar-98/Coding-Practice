Think of all solutions first   --> Then look at th code thoroughly
Target -- O(n) time complexity


On using normal method it takes O(n^2) time on taking each pair.
Whereas on counting the number of 1's it takes O(32*n) time.

Use x=1 and & operator. No need to do bitwise shift operations, instead just do x*2 after each iteration.

Think how its working.
