Link -- https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/palindromic-binary-representation/

## Problem Statement:
Given an integer A find the Ath number whose binary representation is a palindrome.


### NOTE:
1. Consider the 1st number whose binary representation is palindrome as 1, instead of 0.

2. Do not consider the leading zeros, while considering the binary representation.



## Example
### Input 1:
 A = 1
O/P -- 1

### Input 2:
 A = 9
O/P -- 27



## Example Explanation
### Explanation 1:
 1st Number whose binary representation is palindrome is 1

### Explanation 2
 9th Number whose binary representation is palindrome is 27 (11011)
